//For BOT protocol: http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbmassbulk_10.pdf
//For command related details refer to http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbmass-ufi10.pdf
//Data Transfer Conditions
//The host indicates the expected transfer in the CBW using the Direction bit and the
//dCBWDataTransferLength field. The device then determines the actual direction and data transfer length.
//The device responds by transferring data, STALLing endpoints when specified, and returning the appropriate CSW.

//Command Transport
//The host shall send each CBW, which contains a
//command block, to the device via the Bulk-Out
//endpoint. The CBW shall start on a packet boundary
//and end as a short packet with exactly 31 (1Fh) bytes transferred.
//The device shall indicate a successful transport of a
//CBW by accepting (ACKing) the CBW. If the CBW is
//not valid see 6.6.1 - CBW Not Valid or If the host detects
//a STALL of the Bulk-Out endpoint during command
//transport, the host shall respond with a Reset Recovery

//Data Transport
//All data transport shall begin on a packet boundary.
//The host shall attempt to transfer the exact number of
//bytes to or from the device as specified by the
//dCBWDataTransferLength and the Direction bit.
//To report an error before data transport completes and to maximize data integrity, 
//the device may terminate the command by STALLing the endpoint in use (
//the Bulk-In endpoint during data in, the Bulk-Out endpoint during data out).

//Status Transport
//The device shall send each CSW to the host via the Bulk-In endpoint. The CSW shall start on a packet boundary
//and end as a short packet with exactly 13 (Dh) bytes transferred. 
//The CSW indicates to the host the status of the execution of the command block from the corresponding CBW.
//The dCSWDataResidue field indicates how much of the data transferred is to be considered processed or
//relevant. The host shall ignore any data received beyond that which is relevant
//-The host shall perform a Reset Recovery when Phase Error status is returned in the CSW.
//-For Reset Recovery the host shall issue in the following order: :
//(a) a Bulk-Only Mass Storage Reset
//(b) a Clear Feature HALT to the Bulk-In endpoint
//(c) a Clear Feature HALT to the Bulk-Out endpoint

//Host/Device Data Transfers

//A Bulk-Only Protocol transaction begins with the host sending a CBW to the device and attempting to make the
//appropriate data transfer (In, Out or none). The device receives the CBW, checks and interprets it, attempts to
//satisfy the host's request, and returns status via a CSW

//Valid and Meaningful CBW
//------------------------
//The host communicates its intent to the device through the CBW. The device performs two verifications on
//every CBW received. First, the device verifies that what was received is a valid CBW. Next, the device
//determines if the data within the CBW is meaningful.
//The device shall not use the contents of the dCBWTag in any way other than to copy its value to the dCSWTag of
//the corresponding CSW

//The device shall consider the CBW valid when:
// The CBW was received after the device had sent a CSW or after a reset,
// the CBW is 31 (1Fh) bytes in length,
// and the dCBWSignature is equal to 43425355h.
//The device shall consider the contents of a valid CBW meaningful when:
// no reserved bits are set,
// the bCBWLUN contains a valid LUN supported by the device,
// and both bCBWCBLength and the content of the CBWCB are in accordance with
// bInterfaceSubClass


//Valid and Meaningful CSW
//-------------------------
//The device generally communicates the results of its attempt to satisfy the host뭩 request through the CSW. The
//host performs two verifications on every CSW received. First, the host verifies that what was received is a valid
//CSW Next, the host determines if the data within the CSW is meaningful
//Valid CSW
//The host shall consider the CSW valid when:
// the CSW is 13 (Dh) bytes in length,
// and the dCSWSignature is equal to 53425355h,
// the dCSWTag matches the dCBWTag from the corresponding CBW
//Meaningful CSW
//The host shall consider the contents of the CSW meaningful when:
//either the bCSWStatus value is 00h or 01h and the dCSWDataResidue is less than or equal to dCBWDataTransferLength..
//or the bCSWStatus value is 02h.


//Device Error Handling
//----------------------
//The device may not be able to fully satisfy the host's request. At the point when the device discovers that it
//cannot fully satisfy the request, there may be a Data-In or Data-Out transfer in progress on the bus, and the host
//may have other pending requests. The device may cause the host to terminate such transfers by STALLing the appropriate pipe
//Please note that whether or not a STALL handshake actually appears on the bus depends on whether or not there
//is a transfer in progress at the point in time when the device is ready to STALL the pipe.

//Host Error Handling
//----------------------
//If the host receives a CSW which is not valid, then the host shall perform a Reset Recovery. If the host receives
//a CSW which is not meaningful, then the host may perform a Reset Recovery

//Error Classes
//---------------------
//In every transaction between the host and the device, there are four possible classes of errors. These classes are
//not always independent of each other and may occur at any time during the transaction

//1)CBW Not Valid
//If the CBW is not valid, the device shall STALL the Bulk-In pipe. Also, the device shall either STALL the
//Bulk-Out pipe, or the device shall accept and discard any Bulk-Out data. The device shall maintain this state
//until a Reset Recovery

//2)Internal Device Error
//The device may detect an internal error for which it has no reliable means of recovery other than a reset. The
//device shall respond to such conditions by: either STALLing any data transfer in progress and returning a Phase Error status
//(bCSWStatus = 02h)
//or STALLing all further requests on the Bulk-In and the Bulk-Out pipes until a Reset Recovery.

//3)Host/Device Disagreements
//After recognizing that a CBW is valid and meaningful, and in the absence of internal errors, the device may
//detect a condition where it cannot meet the host뭩 expectation for data transfer, as indicated by the Direction bit
//of the bmCBWFlags field and the dCBWDataTransferLength field of the CBW. In some of these cases, the
//device may require a reset to recover. In these cases, the device shall return Phase Error status (bCSWStatus = 02h)

//4)Command Failure
//After recognizing that a CBW is valid and meaningful, the device may still fail in its attempt to satisfy the
//command. The device shall report this condition by returning a Command Failed status (bCSWStatus = 01h)
